# This program is an all around clean up tool I am designing to help me with my 
# penetration testing problems.  This tool is surrounded around the idea that Tenable Nessus Pro
# while doing a good job at vunlerability scanning, fails to provide me with reasonable reporting
# mechanisms.  So this tool will make up for the several shortcomings by slicing, dicing, and manipulating
# data from Tenable Nessus CSV files.
