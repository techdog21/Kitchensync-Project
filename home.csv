  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

that do not have the recursion bit set. 

This may allow a remote attacker to determine which domains have
recently been resolved via this name server, and therefore which hosts
have been recently visited. 

For instance, if an attacker was interested in whether your company
utilizes the online services of a particular financial institution,
they would be able to use this attack to build a statistical model
regarding company usage of that financial institution.  Of course, the
attack can also be used to find B2B partners, web-surfing patterns,
external mail servers, and more.

Note: If this is an internal DNS server not accessible to outside
networks, attacks would be limited to the internal network. This
may include employees, consultants and potentially users on
a guest network or WiFi connection if supported.","Contact the vendor of the DNS software for a fix.","http://cs.unc.edu/~fabian/course_papers/cache_snooping.pdf","

for the authentication protocol.

When possible, Nessus tracks errors or failures related to otherwise
valid credentials in order to highlight issues that may result in
incomplete scan results or limited scan coverage. The types of issues
that are tracked include errors that indicate that the account used
for scanning did not have sufficient permissions for a particular
check, intermittent protocol failures which are unexpected after the
protocol has been negotiated successfully earlier in the scan, and
intermittent authentication failures which are unexpected after a
credential set has been accepted as valid earlier in the scan. This
plugin reports when none of the above issues have been logged during
the course of the scan for at least one authenticated protocol. See
plugin output for details, including protocol, port, and account.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  issues to be encountered for one protocol and not another.
  For example, authentication to the SSH service on the
  remote target may have consistently succeeded with no
  privilege errors encountered, while connections to the SMB
  service on the remote target may have failed
  intermittently.

- Resolving logged issues for all available authentication
  protocols may improve scan coverage, but the value of
  resolving each issue for a particular protocol may vary
  from target to target depending upon what data (if any) is
  gathered from the target via that protocol and what
  particular check failed. For example, consistently
  successful checks via SSH are more critical for Linux
  targets than for Windows targets, and likewise
  consistently successful checks via SMB are more critical
  for Windows targets than for Linux targets.","n/a","","Nessus was able to execute commands locally with sufficient privileges

successful because the authentication protocol service was available

protocol was able to be negotiated successfully, and a set of

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

mDNS) protocol, which allows anyone to uncover information from the
remote host such as its operating system type and exact version, its
hostname, and the list of services it is running. 

This plugin attempts to discover mDNS used by hosts residing on the same
network segment as Nessus.","Filter incoming traffic to UDP port 5353, if desired.","","Nessus was able to extract the following information :

  - mDNS hostname       : Grog.local.

  - Advertised services :
    o Service name      : Grog._rdlink._tcp.local.

consolidates them into a list.","This plugin gathers MAC addresses discovered from both remote probing
of the host (e.g. SNMP and Netbios) and from running local checks
(e.g. ifconfig). It then consolidates the MAC addresses into a single,
unique, and uniform list.","n/a","","The following is a consolidated list of detected MAC addresses:
